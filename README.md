##Udacity Computer Vision Nanodegree

This repository contains my projects submitted to [Udacity Computer Vision Nanodegree] (https://confirm.udacity.com/NE9KEJM6).

In this course I completed three projects.
1. **Facial Keypoint Detection** in which I used Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to detect 68 facial keypoints.
*Description*: In this project, youâ€™ll combine your knowledge of computer vision techniques and deep learning architectures to build a facial keypoint detection system that takes in any image with faces, and predicts the location of 68 distinguishing keypoints on each face!

2. **Image Captioning** in which I used CNN-RNN, CNN to identify the image and RNN for the image captioning using LSTM.
*Description*: In this project, you will create a neural network architecture to automatically generate captions from images.

3. **LandMark Detection and Tracking (SLAM)** : Using SLAM (Simultaneous Location and Mapping) a robust method for tracking object over time and mapping out its surrounding environment.
